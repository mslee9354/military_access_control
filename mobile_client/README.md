# Flutter Mobile Client (Skeleton)

This directory contains a minimal skeleton for a Flutter application that would
scan a QR code and send it to the Python server. It is not a complete
application but illustrates the intended structure.

To build the client, Flutter and the `qr_code_scanner` package are required.
Because dependencies cannot be installed in this environment, no binary is
provided.
